# intro to logic

## Propositions

Definition: a proposition is sa declarative sentence that is either true or false, not both.

e.g. "The sun is in the Solar system."

not a proposition: "Three plus four" -- cannot be evaluated.

Instead of writing sentences, we will abbreviate them by using propositional variables.

Standard practice to use lower case letters: p, q, r...

Then if,

```
p = "It's raining"
q = "I have an umbrella"
```
You can make compound propositions like so:

```
P AND Q
```

## Logical Operators

and (conjunction)
---
```
p and q
p ^ q
```

Or (disjunction)
---
```
p or q
p v q
```

Negation
---
```
not p
Â¬p

Implication
---
```
if p then q
p -> q
p implies q
```
An implication is true when the if-part (p) is false OR when the then-part (q) is true.

So, `p -> q` is equivalent to `(!p) v q`

In other words, an implication is only false when the condition is true but the then-part is not true.  If the if-condition is satisfied but the then-part doesn't pan out.

Biconditional 
```
p if and only if q
p <-> q
p iff q
```
is true when p and q have the same truth values, otherwise false.
