## Propositions

Definition: a proposition is sa declarative sentence that is either true or false, not both.

e.g. "The sun is in the Solar system."

not a proposition: "Three plus four" -- cannot be evaluated.

Instead of writing sentences, we will abbreviate them by using propositional variables.

Standard practice to use lower case letters: p, q, r...

Then if,

```
p = "It's raining"
q = "I have an umbrella"
```
You can make compound propositions like so:

```
P AND Q
```
