Equivalences
-----------

commutativity

```
(p ^ q) = (q ^ p)
(p v q) = (q v p)
```

associativity

```
((p ^ q) ^ n) = (p ^ (q ^ n))
((p v q) v n) = (p v (q v n))
```

contraposition

```
p -> q = ~q -> ~p
```

implication elimination

```
p -> q = ~p v q
```

biconditional elimination

```

```

Satisfiability
------

The general problem of deciding whether a proposition is satisfiable is called *SAT*.  One approach is to build a truth table. 

Is there a more efficient way to solve for SAT?  Nope.  Well, no one knows of one yet.

Tautology and contradiction
------

A tautology is a compound statement that is always true.

```
p v ~p = True
```

A contradiction is a compound statement that is always false.

```
p ^ ~p = False
```

How to prove an inference rule?
----

```
A
A->B
---- 
B
```

How could we prove *Modus Ponens*?

We can construct the following statement, and prove it with a truth table:

```
A ^ (A->B) -> B
```

Basically, **and** together the lines of the inference and make them imply the conclusion of the inference.  

Resolution Rule
------

A v B
~A v C
-----
B v C
